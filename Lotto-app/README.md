# Lottery Guessing Game

This is a simple lottery guessing game implemented in JavaScript. Users input their guesses
(node lotto.js <numbers> [log]) and the program compares them to randomly generated numbers,
providing feedback on the number of correct guesses and how long it takes to get a winning result.

## Features

- User inputs seven numbers between 1 and 40.
- The program generates seven random numbers and compares them with the user's guesses.
- Tracks the number of correct guesses and how many iterations (weeks) it takes to get all seven numbers correct.
- Optional logging to keep track of game progress.
